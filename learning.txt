Using Parallax:

Everything is done with <ParralaxLayer>’s

Parameters are;

	Offset: where the next page start

	Speed: How fast you scroll through the page

	Style: for background images 

	Factor: Allows an image to span multiple pages
	
Sticky: Keeps an image in the same place while the user scrolls

useRef: Allows us to click through pages instead of just scrolling

	“cont ref = userRef()” above the return function
    
    “onClick={()=>ref.current.scrollTo(3)}” tells us what page we want to click to
